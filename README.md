# üìä Bank Churn Prediction ‚Äì Data Analysis & Modeling

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using personal, transactional, and behavioral data. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify the key factors influencing customer loyalty and to anticipate churn, enabling financial institutions to improve their retention strategies.  
The work follows a **full data science pipeline**:
- Data preparation and cleaning  
- Exploratory analysis of demographic & transactional variables  
- Correlation and statistical testing  
- Factor analysis (PCA & LDA)  
- Customer segmentation (K-means clustering)  
- Predictive modeling of churn probability  
- Visualization of insights and results

## üéØ Objectives
- Identify key patterns and factors associated with customer attrition.  
- Reduce data dimensionality for better interpretability.  
- Classify customers into meaningful segments for targeted retention strategies.  
- Build a predictive model to estimate churn probability.

## üìÇ Dataset
- **File:** `BankChurners.csv`  
- **Source:** Provided in the course (similar to public churn datasets).  
- **Structure:** Rows = individual customers, Columns = demographic, transactional, and behavioral variables.  
- **Target Variable:** `Attrition_Flag` (encoded as `1` for attrited customers, `0` for existing customers).

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Identified **quantitative** and **qualitative** variables.  
- Encoded the target variable.  
- Removed irrelevant or unknown values (e.g., `"Unknown"` income category).  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics for each variable.  
- Scatterplots and regression lines to inspect relationships with churn.  
- **Correlation matrix** for numeric variables, visualized with a heatmap.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection & Encoding
- Chi-square tests for qualitative variables to retain only significant ones.  
- One-hot encoding of selected categorical features.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Factor Analysis
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**
  - Standardized numerical features.  
  - Determined optimal number of components for 95% explained variance.  
  - Visualized variance explained, loadings, and correlation circle.  
- **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis):**
  - Projected customers into discriminant space for class separation.  
  - Measured variance explained and classification score on test data.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation ‚Äì K-means
- Used PCA-reduced data as input to clustering.  
- Applied **Elbow method** and **Silhouette score** to choose optimal `k`.  
- Visualized customer clusters and analyzed churn rates per cluster.  
- Created **cluster profiles** via normalized heatmaps of mean feature values.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling
- Split data into training/test sets (80/20, stratified).  
- Preprocessed numeric features (scaling) and categorical features (one-hot encoding).  
- Trained models, including **Logistic Regression**, to predict churn probability.  
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## üìä Key Results
- **PCA:** Significant dimensionality reduction with clear separation between attrited and existing customers.  
- **LDA:** Improved separation and interpretability of churn classes.  
- **K-means:** Optimal clustering identified customer groups with distinct attrition profiles.  
- **Predictive model:** Logistic Regression achieved high precision and strong AUC-ROC performance.  
- **Top churn indicators:** number of products held, months inactive, transaction count, and utilization ratio.
